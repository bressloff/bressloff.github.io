<h3>Stochastic interacting particle systems</h3>
<p>A wide range of phenomena in the natural and social sciences involve large systems of interacting particles, including plasmas, collections of galaxies, coupled oscillators, spiking neural networks, cell aggregations, animal flocking, and economic ``agents'.Important examples of interacting particle systems, include the Kuramoto model of coupled phase oscillators, spiking neural networks, and active matter. Kinetic methods for reducing the complexity of such systems typically involve the derivation of a nonlinear and nonlocal Fokker-Planck equation for the population density in the mean field limit, which is known as a McKean-Vlasov (MV) equation. One of the important features of MV equations is that they can exhibit phase transitions not seen in the corresponding finite particle system. One method for deriving MV-type equations is to construct a weak solution for the global density (empirical measure) using Ito's lemma, and then to average with respect to the noise using a mean field ansatz in the thermodynamic limit (the so-called Dean-Kawasaki method). We are currently extending this approach to include non-trivial features such as stochastic resetting, partially absorbing boundaries, and active switching.</p>

<h3>Applications of singular perturbation theory to active phase separation and protein aggregation</h3>


<p> Singular perturbation theory is a powerful analytical method for solving two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) diffusion problems in domains containing small holes or traps have been removed from the interior. The analysis proceeds by partitioning the domain into a set of inner regions around each hole, and an outer region where mean-field interactions occur. Asymptotically matching the inner and outer stationary solutions, generates an asymptotic expansion of the particle concentration that depends on the positions of the holes and the geometry of the domain. We are currently applying these methods to the active phase separation of biological condensates and to protein aggregation. In the former case, the holes represent high-density droplets within the cytoplasm or cell nucleus, whereas in the latter case they represent protein clusters within the cell membrane.</p>

<p>Liquid-liquid phase separation plays a major role in the formation and maintenance of various membrane-less subcellular structures in the cytoplasm and nucleus of cells. Biological condensates contain enhanced concentrations of proteins and RNA, many of which can be continually exchanged with the surrounding medium. Coarsening is an important step in the kinetics of phase separation, whereby an emulsion of polydisperse condensates transitions to a single condensate in thermodynamic equilibrium with a surrounding dilute phase. A key feature of biological phase separation is the co-existence of multiple condensates over significant time scales. Various hypotheses have been given to account for this slowing: actively driven chemical reactions that maintain the out-of-equilibrium switching of proteins between soluble and phase separating: the mechanical suppression of coarsening mediated by intracellular visco-elastic networks such as the cytoskeleton: the slow conversion of molecular constituents between the dilute and dense phases, which is regulated by various interfacial protein assemblies. 

<p> Protein aggregation occurs during the formation of large-scale molecular assemblies within cell membranes. Examples of such assemblies include lipid rafts, and postsynaptic domains (PSDs) at excitatory and inhibitory synapses in neurons. PSDs are rich in scaffolding proteins that can transiently trap transmembrane neurotransmitter receptors, thus localizing them at specific spatial positions. Hence, PSDs play a key role in determining the strength of synaptic connections and their regulation during learning and memory.</p>

<h3>Encounter-based models of diffusion in partially absorbing domains</h3>
<p>Understanding the diffusion of particles in reactive media is a problem of general mathematical interest, with a wide range of applications in the physical and life sciences. Encounter-based methods provide a general probabilistic framework for modelling absorption on the surface or interior of a target. An absorption event occurs when the contact time with the target exceeds a random threshold. If the probability distribution of the latter is an exponential function, then one recovers the Markovian example of absorption at a constant rate, whereas a non-exponential distribution signifies non-Markovian absorption. In the case of a partially absorbing target interior (surface) the contact time is given by a Brownian functional known as the occupation time (boundary local time). We are currently applying encounter-based methods to a wide range of diffusive and active transport processes, including search processes with stochastic resetting, anomalous diffusion, active run-and-tumble particles, and interacting particle systems.</p>

    <h3>Stochastic models of diffusion through semi-permeable membranes</h3>
<p>Diffusion through semipermeable interfaces has a wide range of applications, including molecular transport through biological membranes, reverse osmosis, synaptic receptor trafficking, and drug delivery. We have developed a probabilistic model of interfacial diffusion based on snapping out Brownian motion (BM). The latter sews together successive rounds of partially reflecting BMs that are restricted to either side (U or V) of a semipermeable interface S. Each round is killed (absorbed) at the interface when its Brownian local time exceeds a random threshold. (The local time is a Brownian functional that keeps track of the amount of contact between a diffusing particle and a boundary surface.) A new round is then immediately started in U with probability p or V with probability 1-p. If p â‰  1/2 (directed transport), then there is a discontinuity in the chemical potential across the interface. The probability density for snapping out BM satisfies a renewal equation that relates the full density to the probability densities of partially reflected BM on either side of the interface. In the case of an exponentially distributed local time threshold, the solution of the renewal equation satisfies the classical diffusion equation for a semi-permeable membrane with constant permeability. On the other hand, if the threshold distribution is non-exponential, then the resulting permeability is a time-dependent function that tends to be heavy-tailed. Current projects include the following: (a) Analyzing the stochastic thermodynamics of diffusion across a semipermeable interface; (b) Connecting the effective permeability with biophysical models of semipermeable membranes. (c) Comparing semipermeable interfaces with actively switching interfaces, and the boundaries of biological condensates; (d) Investigating the screening effects of semipermeable interfaces on stochastic resetting.</p>

<h3>Cytoneme-based morphogenesis and viral spread</h3>
<p>Morphogen protein gradients play an essential role in the spatial regulation of patterning during embryonic development.  The most commonly accepted mechanism of protein gradient formation involves the diffusion and degradation of morphogens from a localized source. Recently, an alternative mechanism has been proposed, which is based on cell-to-cell transport via thin, actin-rich cellular extensions known as cytonemes. It has been hypothesized that cytonemes find their targets via a random search process based on alternating periods of retraction and growth, perhaps mediated by some chemoattractant. We have developed a search-and-capture model of cytoneme-based morphogenesis, in which nucleating cytonemes from a source cell dynamically grow and shrink until making contact with a target cell and delivering a burst of morphogen. Renewal theory can be used to calculate the splitting probabilities and conditional mean first passage times (MFPTs) for the cytoneme to be captured by a given target cell. Moreover, it can be shown that multiple rounds of search-and-capture, morphogen delivery, cytoneme retraction and nucleation events lead to the formation of a morphogen gradient. This can be achieved by formulating the morphogen bursting model as a G/M/infinity queuing process. Current projects include the following: (a) Modeling the accumulation of target cell morphogens as a G/M/1 queue. (b) Incorporating the effects of cytoneme bending in search processes; (c) Developing a model of cytoneme-mediated within-host viral spread.</p>

<h3>Probabilistic formulations of stochastic resetting</h3>
<p>Stochastic resetting is a mechanism whereby a system is returned to its initial state  at a random sequence of times that is typically generated by a Poisson process with constant rate r. The simplest example is a Brownian particle that instantaneously resets to its initial position. There have been a wide range of generalisations at the single particle level. These include both modifications in the underlying stochastic dynamics in the absence of resetting and modifications in the resetting protocol itself (eg. Non-instntaneous resetting due to finite return times and refractory periods, randomly distributed reset points, non-Poissonian resetting etc.) Within the specific application domains of animal movement and cell biology, stochastic resetting has been posited as a mechanism for reducing the expected time to find a hidden target within some large search domain. In the case of a foraging animal, the target represents a local region of resources such as food or shelter, and resetting mimics the observed tendency for an animal to return to its home base in order to rest or resupply. Target detection is said to occur when the particle first reaches a point on the target boundary, which can be implemented by taking the boundary to be a totally absorbing surface. The total search time is given by the first passage time (FPT). One of the limitations of a purely diffusive process as a stochastic search mechanism is that the mean first passage time (MFPT) diverges as the size of the search domain goes to infinity. On the other hand, the introduction of a stochastic resetting protocol can support a finite MFPT that has a unique minimum as a function of the resetting rate. Two examples of search processes with resetting at the cellular level are motor-based vesicular transport and cytoneme-based morphogen transport. In all of the examples the stochastic processes cycle between a diffusive search phase, a ballistic return phase, and a refractory phase.</p>


<p>An alternative physical realisation of non-instantaneous resetting is to consider diffusion in an external trapping or confining potential that is intermittently switched on and off. During an ON phase, a diffusing particle tends to move towards the minimum of the potential, which thus plays an analogous role to the reset position in perfect resetting. This return phase is clearly of finite duration. Moreover, once the particle reaches a neighbourhood of the minimum, it tends to remain there until  switching to an OFF state, which is analogous to a refractory phase. Diffusion in an intermittent potential is an example of a switching diffusion process or stochastic hybrid system.</p> 


</p>We have recently developed probabilistic formulations of instantaneous stochastic resetting and diffusion in an intermittent potential, which are represented as a jump-diffusion process and a switching diffusion (hybrid stochastic) process, respectively. We are currently using such formulations to analyze the following: (a) stochastic thermodynamics with resetting; (ii) interacting particle systems with resetting; (iii) stochastic resetting in partially absorbing media.</p>
