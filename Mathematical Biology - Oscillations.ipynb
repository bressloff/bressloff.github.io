    "# 3. Oscillations and bifurcations\n",
    "\n",
    "Oscillatory or periodic behaviour is fundamental to biological systems.  You need to look no further than your own body to notice examples of periodic rhythms and patterns, such as the beating of our hearts, the inflation and deflation of our lungs, or the circadian cycle governing being asleep or awake, to name just a few.  For each of these processes, we can pinpoint a particular frequency and amplitude with which the oscillations occur.  This is in contrast with the Lotka-Volterra system where we observed the oscillations, in particular their amplitude, are instead highly dependent upon the initial conditions, with many closed orbits circling the centre fixed point.  We'll now examine the existence of isolated closed trajectories, or limit cycles, and study how to predict their frequency and amplitude under certain assumptions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we'll revist bifurcations in the context of multidimensional systems.  While we will see that the bifurcations we encountered in one-dimensional systems exist in a very similar way in the multidimensional context, new types of bifurcations can occur.  In particular, we'll examine the case of the (supercritical) Hopf bifurcation where upon the variation of a parameter, a stable fixed point becomes unstable and the new attractor is a stable limit cycle.  \n",
    "\n",
    "At each step of the way, we'll explore models of biological phenomena that exhibit limit cycles, interpreting their role in the biological process that the model is meant to capture."

Typically, we'd like to be able to estimate the radius and shape of the orbit, as well as its period -- the time required for the solution to go once around orbit.  We'll see how we can ascertain these details under certain conditions or assumptions.  \n",

We saw that certain systems, such as the spruce budworm model, can exhibit hysteresis, where the continuous variation of a parameter caused the fixed point to suddenly 'jump.' In the case of the spruce budworm, this entailed suddenly jumping from the refuge population level to the outbreak level as we increased the parameter $R$.  If we then allowed the parameter to return to its original value, the fixed point did not return to its original location.  Recall that for the system to exhibit hysteresis, we needed to have a region of bistability where two stable fixed points exist for a range of parameter values.\n",

Thus, the solution will follow the nullcline $f_1(u,v) = 0$.  The solution moves along the nullcline until it reaches a local maximum or minimum, at which point it leaves the nullcline and moves rapidly across phase space at a nearly constant value of $v$.  The point at which it leaves the nullcline would correspond to the bifurcation point if $v$ were a parameter in the one-dimensional system.  When its path reaches the nullcline, it moves along it again and the process repeats.  This is depicted in the sketch below.\n",

Hodgkin and Huxley measured the current across the membrane surrounding the axon (the slender appendage eminating from a nerve cell along which electrical signal propagate) due to the passage of different ions through its membrane.  In particular, they measured how membrane permeability differs for the different ions and how all permeabilities (ion conductances) depend on the voltage across the membrane.  Hodgkin and Huxley were awarded the Nobel Prize for this work and developed four-dimensional system of equations based on their measurements. Unfortunately, the resulting system is rather complex leading researchers to develop simpler models that capture the key features of neuron firing, but are more amenable to analysis.  This is where the Fitzhugh-Nagumo models arrives.\n",

Additionally, for relaxation oscillations to occur, we'll need to set the $I_a$ to ensure that at the fixed point we'll have $df/dv > 0$.
